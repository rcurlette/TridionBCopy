TridionBCopy

Copy an item including all its' Blueprint-related children.

Why?
Copying an item in Tridion only copies the parent item - and not any of the children.  

Which items does it work with?
Components, Pages, Structure Groups, Folders, Templates

Note:  Does not copy items within a Folder or Structure Group

Issues?
Copying a Folder gives some security-related error, but the Folder does copy fine and all children.
