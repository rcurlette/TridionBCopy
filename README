TridionBCopy

Copy an item including all its' Blueprint-related children.

Why?
Copying an item in Tridion only copies the parent item - and not any of the children.  

Which items does it work with?
Components, Pages, Structure Groups, Folders

Issues?
Copying a Folder givs some security-related error, but the Fodler does copy fine and all children.
